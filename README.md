## About the Book
This book is a complete guide to design patterns and object-oriented programming (OOP) in C# and .NET. It covers everything from the basics of C# and Visual Studio to advanced topics like software architecture and best coding practices, including the SOLID principles. 

The book starts with the basics of C#, .NET, the SOLID principles, and the OOP paradigm. Then, it introduces widely-used design patterns with hands-on examples in C# and .NET. These examples include real-world scenarios and step-by-step instructions. In addition, the book provides an overview of advanced features in the .NET ecosystem, insights into current market solutions for software strategy, and guidance on when to use a design pattern-centric approach. The book concludes with valuable recommendations and best practices for .NET applications, especially when using design patterns.

## What You Will Learn
